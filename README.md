The [Imaginary Network Expanded](https://www.reddit.com/r/ImaginaryBestOf/wiki/networksublist) (INE) is a network of art sharing subreddits ranging from broad in subject to very specific. It is the goal of the INE to share, inspire, discuss and appreciate paintings, drawings, and digital art while maintaining artist credit and source links.

This dataset was made thanks to the [Hydrus](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/) which was and is still being used to download content from the INE subreddits using subscriptions. Hydrus also allow us to easily add tags to the content we download either manually of by using the [Hydrus PTR](https://hydrusnetwork.github.io/hydrus/PTR.html), thanks to this we can reduce the amount of work needed to make this dataset.
