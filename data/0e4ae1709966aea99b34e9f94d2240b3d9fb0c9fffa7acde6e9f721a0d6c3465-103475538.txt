text:the cloak smells quite purtid and foul, like some sort of chemical waste. any creatures with a sense of smell that start their turn within 10 ft of the cloak must succed on a dc 18 constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of their next turn. on a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench for 24 hours. while gigantasized, the range of tthis effect increases to 30 ft, affects any creature that breathes (not just smells), and any previous immunity to the stench is ignored.,

text:while attuned to this cloak: you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack and damage rolls; you gain the poison spray cantrip (dc 18); you are immune to the poisoned condition; while the cloak's hood is up, you can attempt to hide as a pile of trash, and have advantage on the roll if there is other trash to hide amongst, but disadvantage if you are in a non-urban environment; once between logn rests, as a bonus action you can gigantasize; and if an attack from an enemy within 5 feet of you drops you to 0 hitpoints, they take 1/4 of their hitpoints max in poison damage.,
